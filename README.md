# express-ejs-template
The idea behind this project is to create a website template suitable for small to medium-sized businesses or a personal page. The main technologies used are Node.js Express, EJS, and SQLite for the database. My only use of EJS will be for including common sections of the website to make it easier to manage, and I won't be using any other EJS features. I am fairly new to using these technologies, and this project is by no means an example of a professional implementation. Over time, I will add more features and clean/comment the code, so stay tuned!

## To-Do List
- [ ] Create scripts to clear the project so it can be used from scratch.
- [ ] Add secure backend for managing messaging and blog posts.
- [ ] Add a merch store.
- [ ] Create script to compile the site for production.
