            <h1>Enron: Where Integrity Meets Creativity!</h1>
            <p>At Enron, we pride ourselves on being the pioneers of innovation in the energy industry. With our unparalleled dedication to creativity and our commitment to thinking outside the box (and sometimes outside the law), we have established ourselves as the gold standard in corporate shenanigans.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>To redefine what it means to be a trustworthy corporate entity by pushing the boundaries of ethics and accountability.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To maximize shareholder value by any means necessary, even if it means bending a few rules along the way.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Core Values</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Ingenuity: </b>We believe that creativity knows no bounds, especially when it comes to financial engineering.</li>
                <li><b>Integrity: </b>Our integrity is as flexible as our accounting practices.</li>
                <li><b>Transparency: </b>We are committed to transparency, as long as it's opaque enough to hide our dubious dealings.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Meet the masterminds behind Enron's success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Jeffrey "Creative Accounting" Skilling: </b> Our visionary CEO who turned Enron into a financial rollercoaster ride. He's a wizard with numbers, especially when they're creatively manipulated.</li>
                <li><b>Ken "The Puppetmaster" Lay: </b>Our charismatic founder and chairman, whose leadership style can be summed up in three words: plausible deniability.</li>
                <li><b>Andrew "The Enforcer" Fastow: </b>Our CFO extraordinaire, known for his innovative use of off-balance-sheet financing and special purpose entities.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
            <p>At Enron, we believe in giving back to the communityâ€”preferably with other people's money. Our philanthropic efforts include sponsoring lavish parties, funding politicians' campaigns, and contributing to the enrichment of our executives' offshore bank accounts.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Join Us</h2>
            <p>Are you a maverick with a knack for financial alchemy? Do you thrive in an environment where ethics are optional and creativity is king? Then Enron might just be the place for you! Apply now and join us on our journey to redefine corporate integrity.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Enron cannot be held responsible for any loss of retirement savings, bankruptcy, or criminal charges resulting from our innovative business practices. Invest at your own risk!</p>
