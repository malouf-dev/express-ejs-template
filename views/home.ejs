                <p class="publish-date">Published: November 30, 2000</p>
                <p>As I sit in the quiet before the proverbial storm—though in our case, it’s a storm of success—I can't help but reflect on the monumental journey Enron has embarked upon. Tomorrow marks not just another day in the calendar of our remarkable company but a day that will be remembered as the pinnacle of our unmatched achievements in the energy sector and beyond.</p>
                <p>At Enron, we've always prided ourselves on being at the cutting edge, not just keeping pace with the market but setting the tempo for others to follow. Our innovative practices in energy trading and our groundbreaking approach to financial management have not only redefined the industry; they've sculpted a new world order of corporate excellence.</p>
                <p>Under my stewardship, Enron has navigated the complex landscapes of global energy with the grace of a gazelle, coupled with the foresight of an eagle. It’s this unique blend of agility and vision that has propelled us from a humble natural gas company to a global powerhouse. My leadership philosophy is simple: Lead with conviction, and success will follow. And follow it has.</p>
                <p>Critics have often questioned our methods, hinting at a lack of transparency or too bold a strategy in our financial dealings. To them, I say, innovation is not for the faint-hearted. Enron’s commitment to pushing the boundaries—whether in pioneering trading strategies or in our financial reporting—has set us leagues apart from the pedestrian practices of our competitors.</p>
                <p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the incredible team of visionaries and innovators here at Enron. From our top executives to our dedicated employees, each and every member of the Enron family plays a vital role in shaping the future of energy. Together, we're building a brighter, more sustainable world for generations to come.</p>
                <p>To our esteemed employees, I extend a heartfelt thank you. Your dedication and brilliance are the lifeblood of Enron. Together, we have built more than a company; we have forged an empire of innovation and success. As we look to the horizon, let us march forward with the knowledge that we are unstoppable.</p>
                <p>On the eve of what promises to be a historic day for Enron, I am reminded of the words of the great Winston Churchill: "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." And continue we shall, toward a future so bright, it blinds.</p>
                <p>To our detractors, prepare to watch in awe. To our believers, ready yourselves for the rewards of a lifetime. Tomorrow, Enron shines brighter than ever.</p>
                <p>Ken Lay<br>Chairman, Enron Corporation</p>
